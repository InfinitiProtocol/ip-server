What is the Infiniti Protocol?
---------------------------

As business use cases for blockchain technology become better developed, the means of sharing data between blockchains has not progressed nearly as far.  The Infiniti Protocol is a means by which Hyperledger, Ethereum, and certain Bitcoin-based blockchain networks which meet specific technical criteria might share data on a per-application basis.  This is a departure from what is normally considered blockchain development best practices, but those current practices do not consider redundancy or portability.
